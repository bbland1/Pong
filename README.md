# Pong

A basic replication of Pong that can be ran on the user's computer with python using tkinter. The user will download the code and run it with the script below. Then 2 players or someone skilled enough to play themselves will control the 2 paddles. The right paddle is controlled with the "up" and "down" arrows and the left is controlled with the "w" and "s" buttons respectively.

The first person to 5 points wins.

What is used: Python and Turtle

To play this game the code would have to be forked or copied. Then run the code with 

`python main.py`(if your python3 is aliased for python) or `python3 main.py`

*I think it would work on tkinter 8.5 but to not get the warning using whatever distribution method of python you want just make sure it has tkinter updated with it*

**Personal highlights:**
I realized I think I like the game pong. I don't think I had played it much until this moment but it was pretty cool. As for the code, this felt like more of smooth experience. I felt like I was getting both the code, the logic and like how python is used in a variety of things. Before I think I was seeing python too 1D.

**Struggles while building:**
The feeling of things need to be more complicated than necessary. Sometimes the solution was right in front of me but I wasn't confident that was the right thing so I would search for a hard answer I guess.

**What I learned:**
Trust yourself, yes sometimes you are wrong but selling yourself short before trying just gets you nowhere.
